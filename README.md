 Neuron Modelling Project

The Hodgkin-Huxley model, a venerable tool in computational neuroscience, serves as our conduit to understanding the intricate dynamics of neuronal membrane voltage.
This project documents a comprehensive exploration involving the implementation, calibration, and automatic recalibration of the Hodgkin-Huxley model.
The language Python was used to unravel the periodic spiking behaviour inherent in neurons.

It therefore compares the model with a fine tuning version to see the flaws and improves on the current version.
